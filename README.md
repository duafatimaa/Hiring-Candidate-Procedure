# Criteria for Hiring Developers
Hiring a developer is a crucial decision for any organization, and it is important to evaluate their skills and expertise before making a hiring decision. Some of the criteria to consider while hiring developers include their technical skills, work experience, problem-solving abilities, communication skills, and cultural fit. Additionally, it's important to assess the developer's coding ability by reviewing their previous work and assessing their coding style, documentation practices, and ability to write maintainable code.

## Checking the difference between a good and bad developer work
A good developer is someone who writes clean, maintainable, and efficient code that meets the requirements of the project. On the other hand, a bad developer may produce poorly written code that is hard to understand and maintain, or they may take shortcuts that compromise the quality of the project. To check the difference between good and bad developer work, it's important to review their codebase and evaluate their coding style, documentation practices, and adherence to best practices.

Adding "#" and given instructions and comment on every code if a non-developer goes through it
When writing code, it's important to make it readable and understandable for other developers who may need to work on the project in the future. Adding comments and instructions in the codebase can help other developers understand the purpose and functionality of each code block. This is especially important when working on complex projects or when collaborating with other developers.

## Adding a proper README file
A README file is a document that contains information about a project, including its purpose, installation instructions, and usage guidelines. A well-written README file can help other developers understand the project and how to use it. It's important to include relevant information in the README file, such as dependencies, setup instructions, and usage examples.

## Adding proper task files in the repository
Task files are a way of organizing and tracking the progress of a project. By breaking down a project into smaller tasks, it's easier to manage and prioritize the work. Adding task files to the repository can help other developers understand the project's scope and the progress that has been made. It's important to include relevant information in the task files, such as the task's priority, estimated time to completion, and dependencies.

## Having 500 commits and proper GitHub know-how
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration that is commonly used by developers. Having proper GitHub know-how is important for developers, as it enables them to collaborate with others and manage their codebase effectively. Additionally, having 500 commits is a good indicator of a developer's experience and dedication to their work.

## Strategies for Hiring People
When hiring people, it's important to have a clear strategy in place to ensure that you find the right candidates for the job. Some strategies to consider include:

- Searching for people who are in the area and have an average salary of less than 15-25k.
- Looking for people who are cheap but can be worth it if they are trained.
- Offering unpaid internships to people who are not skillful but can be trained.
- Training interns until they have 500 commits and have learned everything.
- Offering a paid job after the internship to loyal and well-trained interns.

## Conclusion
Hiring the right people is essential for the success of any organization, and it's important to have a clear strategy in place when recruiting new talent. By considering the criteria for hiring developers, checking the difference between good and bad developer work, adding proper documentation and task files to the repository, and offering training and internships, organizations can find the right people for the job and help them grow into valuable members of the team.
